# SQL Workshop

This is a workshop containing 2 sql exercies, the first one is about how to create a table and do simple queries and the second one is slighty more advanced you do queries into a database which contains information about world population.

## 1st Part

Create a table named friends with three columns:
 - `id` that stores **INTEGER** it needs to be set as a primary key and can't be null
 - `name` that stores **TEXT** up to 150 characters
 - `birthday` that stores **DATE**
​

Beneath your current code, add ***Jane Doe*** to friends.

Her birthday is May 30th, 1990.
​

Add two new friends to the table.
Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them
(name : Clara Doe / John Smith)
​​

Jane Doe just got married! Her new last name is “Smith”.
​
She also discovered internet. Add a new column named email. Jane Smith’s email is jane@wildcodeschool.fr
​

Wait, Jane didn't have a sister, Clara Doe is not a real person.
Remove her from friends.​


Do a **SELECT** to show the content of this table.
