# SQL Workshop

This is a workshop containing 2 sql exercies, the first one is about how to create a table and do simple queries and the second one is slighty more advanced you do queries into a database which contains information about world population.

## 1st Part

Create a table named friends with three columns:
 - `id` that stores **INTEGER** it needs to be set as a primary key and can't be null
 - `name` that stores **TEXT** up to 150 characters
 - `birthday` that stores **DATE**
​

Beneath your current code, add ***Jane Doe*** to friends.

Her birthday is May 30th, 1990.
​

Add two new friends to the table.
Insert a name, and birthday for each of them
(name : Clara Doe / John Smith)
​​

Jane Doe just got married! Her new last name is “Smith”.
​
She also discovered internet. Add a new column named email. Jane Smith’s email is jane@wildcodeschool.fr
​

Wait, Jane didn't have a sister, Clara Doe is not a real person.
Remove her from friends.​


Do a **SELECT** to show the content of this table.


## 2nd Part

Create a new database and use the data from [this file](./data.sql) to start working on:


 - What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?
 - What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?
 - What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?
 - How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?
 - What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?

***Note: it’s okay to figure out the difference by hand after pulling the correct data.***

### Extra

Learn to dump an extra file to your database instead of copy-pasting it and also to export your 1st exercise database to a .sql file
